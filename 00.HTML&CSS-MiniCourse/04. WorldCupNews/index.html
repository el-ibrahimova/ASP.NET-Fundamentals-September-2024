        <h1>World Cup News</h1>
        <p>The biggest scoreline in the history of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers - and indeed in the history of international football 
            - was recorder on 11 April 2001, when Austria beat American Samoa 31-0.
        </p>
        <p>This legendary match also brought global renown for Archie Thompson, whose 13-goal haul set a new world record, 
            which stands to this day, for an individual player in a single international match. 
        </p>
        <p>And though the defeat earned American Samoa ignominy, so inspiring has their subsequent recovery been
            that it is now the subject of an acclaimed documentary, "Next Goal Wins", showing across the world.
